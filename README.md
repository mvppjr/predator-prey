## Project Description

###### **What we're doing!**

As it stand, our plan is to evolve a team of two predators to seek out a prey. The prey will have an advantage because it will be able to move at a faster speed than both predators. Therefore, the two predators will have to work together to capture the prey. To make sure things aren't too easy, we're also planning on create a map that has lots of obstacles that the bots will have to navigate / learn to their advantage / figure out. We plan to use a genetic algorithm or an evolution strategy to evolve the predators. Not sure what we're going to use for the prey.


###### **What is XPilot?**

XPilot is an open-source 2-dimensional space combat simulator which is playable over the internet. Multiple players can connect to a central XPilot server and compete in many varieties of game play, such as free-for-all combat, capture-the-flag, or team combat. Each player controls a space-ship that can turn, thrust, and shoot. There is often a variety of weapons and ship upgrades available on the particular map in which they play. The game uses synchronized client/server networking to allow for solid network play.
